 <h2 class="heading">Description:</h2>
 <ul class="list">
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable/canola oil</li>
    <li>2 cups white rice long or medium grain</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sofrito</li>
    <li>4 ounces tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon adobo seasoning</li>
    <li>2 teaspoon sazon</li>
    <li>15.5 ounces pink/red kidney beans (or 1 cup cooked beans)</li>
    <li>2 cups of water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Spanish green olives</li>
 </ul>
 <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
 <ol class="list2">
    <li>First, rinse the rice a few times and remove any dirt or foreign pieces. Rinse until water is no longer cloudy. Then, drain the water from the rice.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a caldero or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add the rice. Toast and mix for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together sofrito, tomato sauce, adobo, and sazon. Pour and mix into the rice.</li>
    <li>Combine beans and olives with the rice. Add 2 cups of water, about 1 inch above the rice. Mix.
    </li>
    <li>Without a lid, bring the rice to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until the liquid has been mostly cooked off. Then, gently mix the rice from side to center. Reduce heat to low and cover with a lid.</li>
    <li>Cook the rice for an additional 20 minutes, until rice is tender and cooked through.</li>
